The current version features six divine traits that players can acquire: God of War, God of Wisdom, God of Shadow, God of Nature, God of Faith, and God of the Sea. Each god has a unique path to attainment, and only one of each kind can exist in the world. Upon acquiring a divine trait, both AI and players unlock unique units, gain the ability to declare war at will, and receive a host of powerful buffs. AI will more easily acquire these traits than players. \nYou can explore in detail how to become a deity."

The religious beliefs of some countries in continental regions have been changed to those unique to this mod. \n6. Some NPCs with the 'Saints in the flesh' trait will randomly appear on the game map, each extremely powerful (like humanoid Gundams)."
