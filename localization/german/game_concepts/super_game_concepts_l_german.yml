 game_concept_super_god: "God"
 game_concept_super_god_desc: "The birth of a god is closely related to the origins of the world. Our world was once as chaotic and disordered as the dimension outside the World Rift. Numerous lives and even civilizations were born in this dimension, but they were quickly destroyed due to the chaos. However, even in such a dimension, a miracle occurred: a life born in this world accidentally understood the laws of this chaotic dimension and named it space-time. By understanding these laws, this life gained the ability to reshape the dimension, organizing the chaotic space-time and forging a space-time chain to firmly lock the chaos. Thus, a stable and orderly world emerged, and the life that understood the world's laws was called a god."
 game_concept_super_base_god: "The Origin God"
 game_concept_super_base_god_desc: "In the first era after the God of Space-Time stabilized the world, it was still quite empty. Although life was born, it remained desolate. This continued until the seventh era, when the space-time chain began to collapse. The world didn't collapse, but some powerful laws began to operate off their original trajectories, adding a hint of chaos and bringing vitality back to the world. By the end of this era, a combination of laws and newly born life and matter led to the emergence of cosmic stars, plants, animals, suns, rivers, etc. These combinations maintained a delicate balance and created a vibrant world. Among these laws, three controlled the course of the entire space-time chain and were known as the Origin Powers: the powers of Space-Time, Destiny, and Hope."
 game_concept_super_six_nature_god: "The Six Nature Gods"
 game_concept_super_six_nature_god_desc: "Among the many laws of the world, aside from the incomprehensible and the three Origin Laws, six laws control the majority of human affairs: the powers of War, Wisdom, Shadow, Nature, Faith, and the Sea. These powers cannot normally fall into the hands of one person, but if someone were to gather them through special means, the combined power might be able to leverage one of the origins of space-time and gain the power to control destiny."
 game_concept_super_otherworld_god: "The Outerworld God"
 game_concept_super_otherworld_god_desc: "Gods from unknown worlds, their beings filled with a detestable chaos, perhaps originating from the chaotic laws present at the birth of the world."
 game_concept_god_of_destiny: "The God of Destiny"
 game_concept_god_of_destiny_desc: "The God of Destiny controls the power of destiny. He was a tyrant who unified all kingdoms in ancient times, a loathsome ambitious, a petty retaliator, but also once a strong warrior who defeated gods with a mortal body. In the ninth era, civilization reached a high point of prosperity. \nIn the era when Paras was born, magic was at its peak, and many methods to harness the power of laws were discovered. Some weak laws created minor gods, while some powerful laws were partially leveraged and linked to crafted treasures. By chance, Paras obtained the Destiny Scroll linked to the power of destiny, sparking his ambition to become the God of Destiny. Using the origin law's power from the scroll, he discovered how to acquire the power of destiny: control enough laws that could change the world's course. With such power, Paras could draw his ascension as the God of Destiny on the Destiny Scroll, ultimately gaining the true power to control his and others' fates irrevocably."
 game_concept_god_of_time: "The God of Time"
 game_concept_god_of_time_desc: "The God of Time controls the power of space-time, the creator of our world, the vanguard against chaos. \nThe power of space-time held by the God of Time is not the entirety of the space-time law. Accurately, he grasps the essence of space-time, can turn chaos into order, and vice versa. He can travel between different space-time worlds. Therefore, the God of Time is the most vital among the three Origin Gods. Unless all his avatars in every timeline are killed, the God of Time is immortal."
 game_concept_god_of_sun: "The God of Hope"
 game_concept_god_of_sun_desc: "The power representing hope is the jump point and uncontrollable factor of space-time, representing chaos within the space-time law. Its existence caused the space-time chain, forged for the space-time law, to irreversibly collapse over several eras. Even futures determined by the power of destiny can be forcibly broken by the power of hope. However, such breaking leads to chaos and disorder. Any space-time interfered with by the power of hope becomes unpredictable. \nIn the 9th era, the law of hope combined with the concept of \"light,\" and subsequently, the God of Hope was also known as the God of Light or the Sun God. The power of hope is not easily obtained. After the God of Destiny ended the 9th era and started his tyrannical rule in the 10th era, his ambition inflated. He sought more power, aiming for all three space-time laws, with the power of hope as his first target.\nHowever, the power of hope was not easily obtained and couldn't be acquired by one who already possessed the power of destiny. So, the God of Destiny again used the trick of controlling the six gods, intending to control the God of Hope through a magical curse, making him a puppet. But he underestimated the power of hope and overestimated his cunning. Under the influence of the power of hope, his control over space-time was disturbed, allowing a young man to fool him and completely control the power of hope."
 game_concept_god_of_nature: "The God of Nature"
 game_concept_god_of_nature_desc: "The power of nature controls forests, plants, and wild beasts. A girl, trained by Paras from a young age, eventually became the God of Nature."
 game_concept_god_of_dark: "The God of Shadow"
 game_concept_god_of_dark_desc: "In the apocalyptic war that ended the 10th era, the physical body of the God of Destiny was destroyed, but his spirit still left avatars in the flow of space-time. Believing his destruction was due to insufficient control over the power of destiny, he decided to create a new god as his power source. Using the remaining Destiny Scroll, he elevated a human named Ighos, filled with hatred, to heights unmatched by ordinary gods. Thus, Ighos became the apostle of the God of Destiny in the 11th era. He then manipulated Ighos to inject the accumulated resentment of the old continent into an infant, successfully elevating it to the God of Shadow."
 game_concept_god_of_wisdom: "The God of Wisdom"
 game_concept_god_of_wisdom_desc: "In the prosperous 9th era, there was a child obsessed with knowledge. One day, a mysterious cloaked figure, unidentifiable in appearance, lured the child away with endless books. The child, having gained vast knowledge, was ecstatic until the moment of becoming a god when he realized he had been cursed. \nHowever, as the God of Wisdom, the child was not without countermeasures. He deduced a method to summon the God of Time from ancient texts and established a secret connection with him. Through this connection, he glimpsed the essence of space-time law, creating the Stellar Whale and Star Realm Compass, allowing magicians and adventurers to freely traverse the World Rift."
 game_concept_god_of_sea: "The God of the Sea"
 game_concept_god_of_sea_desc: "The God of the Sea was originally a brave maritime warrior, proficient in various combat magics. During a voyage, an abnormal storm wrecked his ship and pulled him into the ocean's abyss. Instead of dying, he obtained a trident controlling the power of the sea. Since then, he became a powerful deity. \nHowever, fate is often strikingly similar. Years later, under the pressure of two gods and the Destiny Scroll, he was forced to submit to Paras and then betrayed Paras in the apocalyptic war, delivering a fatal blow."
 game_concept_god_of_belief: "The God of belief"
 game_concept_god_of_belief_desc: "To create the God of Faith, Paras covertly supported a religion and used the Destiny Scroll to promote it from the shadows. In Paras' eyes, the only flaw of the God of Faith was taking his doctrines too seriously, valuing his followers more than the God of Destiny."
 game_concept_god_of_war: "The God of War"
 game_concept_god_of_war_desc: "In the 8th era, humans were not the dominant species on the continent; dragons were. Among them, a red dragon king was the most powerful. The red dragon, indifferent to dragon affairs, was keen on exploring the vast unknown world. On an isolated island, it met a human adventurer and formed a deep friendship, eventually becoming brothers in arms, with the red dragon embodying the power of war. After sharing his power, the God of War emerged. \nTheir power was unmatched in the 8th era, exploring and conquering every region of the world, establishing the first unified kingdom and starting the 9th era. \nHowever, the War God did not truly possess the power of war. After using various secret arts to live for nearly ten thousand years, the War God eventually passed away, and the red dragon, having transformed its power into an armor, gifted it to the War God's only son and quietly left. The son, possessing the complete power of war, brought prolonged prosperity to the kingdom, ushering in the era that created the Destiny Scroll."
 game_concept_god_of_ark: "God of Ark"
 game_concept_god_of_ark_desc: "The counter-directional effect on the chain of time and space by human societies that have been operating steadily for more than a dozen epochs has led to the emergence of gods in the world that are truly human."
